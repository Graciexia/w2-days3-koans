## in class assignment time

I would like a ruby program that
when I run it asks me my age.

Then it tells me what I can do based on my age.

If I am less than 18 I can do nothing.

If I am older than 18 I can vote (and smoke).

If I am older than 21 I can drink.

If I am older than 25 I can rent a car.


BONUS:
  Ask me my age in a loop so I can change my age after I have given it the first time.
  (Ask me if I want to try again)

  BONUS - BONUS:
    Use methods.
